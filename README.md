# Java3DMaze
A demo 3D maze game done in Java using JOGL libraries.

The maze is automatically generated by the program by reading a text file (by default uses maze_layout_1). The text file consists of x's, o's, s's and e's written in a grid formation - each letter represens each block of the maze. X's mark the pathways, O's mark the walls, S - start block and E - exit block. The first line of the text file denotes the height of the grid, and the second line - the width. The default layout looks like this:

5
9
xsoxxoxxo
xooxooxoo
xxxxoxxxx
oooxooxox
oxxxxxxoe

To move around the maze, use the arrow buttons.
